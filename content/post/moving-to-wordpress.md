I’ve used [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org "Drupal") to power my blog
since I started it over 2 years ago. It has been a bitter sweet
relationship, but in general I’ve been pleased. In those two years,
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org "WordPress") as a product has rocketed
past Drupal, and feels much more mature. While Drupal 7 should level the
field a bit, it’s a ways away and WordPress 3.0 is already here.
