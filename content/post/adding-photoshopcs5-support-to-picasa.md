If you are like me you use Picasa to manage your photos, but recognize
that the editing options are very limited. You can easily add a button
in Picasa that will allow you to edit the current picture in photoshop.

I took an existing button built for PhotoshopCS3 and updated it to work
with this more contemporary version. Itâ€™s limited to working only on
Windows.

[Install Photoshop CS5 Button in
Picasa](picasa://importbutton/?url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/spf13-cdn/uploads/PhotoshopCS5.pbz)

This will open in Picasa (may prompt you to allow this) and add the
button.

The original Photoshop button was created by [Michael
Herf](http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2008/03/add-your-own-buttons-to-picasa-upload.html).
