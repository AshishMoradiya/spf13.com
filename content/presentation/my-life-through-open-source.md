## Lists

### Bullet lists

- This is a list item
* This is another list item in the same list
- You can mix `-` and `*`
   - To make a sub-item, indent two spaces.
      - This is a sub-sub-item.

<!-- separate lists -->

- This is a new list. With Hugo, you need to use a HTML comment to separate two
  consecutive lists.
- Bullet lists can have paragraphs or block elements within them.

  Just indent the content to be even with the text of the bullet point, rather
  than the bullet itself.

  ```bash
  ls -l
  ```

  - And a sub-list after some block-level content
- A bullet list item can contain a numbered list.
  1.  Numbered sub-list item 1
  2.  Numbered sub-list item 2

### Numbered lists

1.  This is a list item
2.  This is another list item in the same list. The number you use in Markdown
    does not necessarily correlate to the number in the final output. By
    convention, we keep them in sync.
3.  For single-digit numbered lists, using two spaces after the period makes
    interior block-level content line up better along tab-stops.
