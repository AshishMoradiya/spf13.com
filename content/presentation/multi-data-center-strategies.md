Strategies for multi-data center deployment. Diving into the details of
deploying of MongoDB across multiple data centers.

Covers the advantages of a multi data center deployment for read/write
locality, the various deployment strategies, and disaster preparedness
and recovery.

In addition, we’ll look at the MongoDB roadmap and planned enhancements
around data center awareness.

This presentation was given at MongoNYC 2012. The animations didn’t
survive the transformation to the web, so not all the meaning carries
over perfectly.
