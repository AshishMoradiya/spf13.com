10gen had our flagship conference in Silicon Valley. I gave an
introductory presentation at the first session on building an
application in MongoDB. This talk will introduce the features of MongoDB
by walking through how one can building a simple location-based
application using MongoDB. It covers the basics of MongoDB’s document
model, query language, map-reduce framework and deployment architecture.
