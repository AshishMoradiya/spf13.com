I wrote this presentation with [Jessie Frazelle](https://blog.jessfraz.com/). She made it look very nice and delivered it at the "Go Contributor Workshop" at [GopherCon](https://www.gophercon.com/). Some of the instructions are clearly only relevant to that workshop, but the vast majority of the presentation should be helpful to anyone wanting to contribute to Go.
