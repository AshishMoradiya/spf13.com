Go has been embraced by developers all over the world. Our community of lovable gophers is over one million strong and growing exponentially. Many of today’s most popular open source projects are built in Go including Kubernetes, Hugo and Docker. Go is critical to modern cloud companies including Microsoft, Google, Alibaba, Cloudflare, and Dropbox. Beyond the cloud, Go is enabling innovations across many industries. In this talk I’ll talk about the history of Go, what is driving Go’s rapid growth, and what’s next for the Go language.

在全球范围内，拥抱Go语言的开发者越来越多，Go语言的爱好者人数已经超过一百万，并正在呈指数级增长。而且，当今多数流行的开源项目都是用Go语言构建的，例如Kubernetes、Hugo 和Docker，对于目前很受关注的云计算公司如Microsoft、Google、Alibaba、Cloudflare 和 Dropbox来说，Go语言同样至关重要。

此外，Go还在很多跨领域方面提供创新机会。本次演讲，Steve会简单介绍Go语言的历史，快速发展的推动力，以及未来Go语言会有哪些新动作和方向的内容。
