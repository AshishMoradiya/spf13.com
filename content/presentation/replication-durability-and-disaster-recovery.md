This session introduces the basic components of high availability before
going into a deep dive on MongoDB replication. We’ll explore some of the
advanced capabilities with MongoDB replication and best practices to
ensure data durability and redundancy. We’ll also look at various
deployment scenarios and disaster recovery configurations.
