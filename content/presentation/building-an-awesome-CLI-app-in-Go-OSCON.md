A workshop written and delivered by [Steve Francia](https://spf13.com) and [Ashley McNamara](https://twitter.com/ashleymcnamara) at [OSCON
2017](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx) outlining the techniques, principles, and libraries you need to create
user-friendly command-line interfaces and command suites before walking you
through building your own app. Along the way, you’ll cover everything from how
to design and build commands to working with and parsing flags, config files
and remote config systems, and how to work with environment variables and
12-factor apps. By the end of the workshop, you’ll have a working knowledge of
Go and your very own functioning CLI app.
