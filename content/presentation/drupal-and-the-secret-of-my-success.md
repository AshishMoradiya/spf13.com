As my tenure on the [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association) was concluding, I was asked to give the Keynote for DrupalCon. It was my privilage to talk about my 20 year history with open source and how much I learned from and valued the Drupal community. [Dries](https://dri.es), Drupal's founder gave a touching [shoutout on his blog](https://dri.es/how-drupal-influences-other-open-source-projects) afterwards.
